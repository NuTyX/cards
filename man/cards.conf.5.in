There are a few values to be configured: the location where to look
for the ports, the location of the log file and the location of the 
base system packages.

.LP
Every line can contain one configuration option. The format of the lines
is
.B <key> <value>.
The valid keys are
.B collection
The value for 
.B collection
is a directory.

.LP
The log options are
.B logfile
which represent the file path of the logs

.LP
The order of the dir options is important, as if a port is in multiple
directories, cards will use the one found first (directories listed
first have precedence)

.LP
If you specify an url in after a | symbol, it will used binaries from this url. In our example, we
will used the default mirror from nutyx.org.As you can see on this example above they are two syntaxes possible:
The default URL which is normaly the URL of the root server or a specific URL include specific version
