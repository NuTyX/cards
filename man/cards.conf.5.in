.LP
There are a few values to be configured: the location where to look
for the ports, the location of the log file and the location of the 
base system packages.

.LP
Every line can contain one configuration option. The format of the lines
is
.B <key> <value>.
The valid keys are
.B dir
The value for 
.B prtdir 
is a directory, or a directory|an URL

.LP
The log options are
.B logfile
which represent the file path of the logs

.LP
The order of the dir options is important, as if a port is in multiple
directories, cards will use the one found first (directories listed
first have precedence)

.LP
If you specify an url in after a | symbol, it will used binaries from this url. In our exemple, we
will used the default mirror from nutyx.org.
