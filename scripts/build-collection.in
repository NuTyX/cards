 1. INTRODUCTION

 This script is able to compile any port from any official collections that
 are one of:

 - base, cli ,cli-extra, gui, gui-extra or <yours>

 IMPORTANTS NOTES:

 a. We make a difference only for base, cli and gui
    and their -extra counterparts.
    Example: to compile the all cli-extra collection
    on the stable version, the syntax will be:

    build-collection /stable/cli-extra
    As simple as that :)

 b. You need about 10 Gbytes of free space for the mirror of NuTyX (/srv/www),
    Also be aware that /srv/www/sources will continuously grow.

 c. The installed NuTyX should ALWAYS be under /development, /current or /stable.

 2. HOW DOES THIS WORK ?

  The script will do following steps:

  - install a development, current or stable NuTyX
    (define by the first part of the first argument)
    into a folder (define by the first argument as well)
  - install the devel packages
  - mount the depot needed for the specific collection
    (define by the first argument)
  - mount the ports needed for the specific collection
  - mount the sources and logs folders
  - enter (chroot) in the installed NuTyX
  - run the script found in /tmp folder which is buildup by
    collecting info from arguments
  - will compile what has to be compile with or without success
    but in both cases it will...
  - exit the installed NuTyX
  - umount the depot, the ports, the sources and logs folders.

 3. ARGUMENTS:

 You can pass 1 or 2 arguments:

 Parameter 1 (mandatory):
  Its specify the version we are going to use (currently it can be 'development' or 'stable'
  and its specify the collection which is one of following possible collection:
  base, cli, cli-extra, gui, gui-extra or your specific collection which can be named anything.

 Parameter 2 (optionnal):
  This parameter works only with base, cli, cli-extra, gui, gui-extra collections.
  This parameter specify the port you want to build only.
  Example:

   build-collection /development/cli-extra irssi

  This example will build (or rebuild) the irssi binaries only

 3. CONFIGURATION OF THE HOST NuTyX

 Its absolutly necessary to configure properly your NuTyX host machine otherwise nothing will work like expected.

 Configuration file that is involve in the configuration process:

 - /etc/fstab

 As explained above, we mount a lot of folders, means they HAVE TO BE specified in the /etc/fstab or specified via
 variables (see http://www.nutyx.org/fr/build-bot).
 As we used predefined /DEPOT, /sources and /LGOS folders, they can be specify via variable or all in /etc/fstab file:

 Here an example for the cli-extra collection of the development version
 you should specify following lines, adapted to your needs:

/srv/www/sources /development/cli-extra/sources none bind
/srv/www/x86_64/development /development/cli-extra/DEPOT none bind
/srv/www/logs/x86_64/development/cli-extra /development/cli-extra/LOGS none bind
/home/thierry/git/extra /development/cli-extra/root/extra none bind
  

 4. Setup all the needed folders and get the official depot into the
 /srv/www location (adapt the folder to yours)

  We create all the necessary folders (for our cli-extra collection example):

    mkdir -p /srv/www/sources
    mkdir -p /srv/www/logs/x86_64/development/cli-extra

  To get all the binaries locally and used them (highly recommended) we need to rsync them:
  for DIR in base cli
  do
   rsync -av --delete  \
   rsync://downloads.nutyx.org/nutyx/x86_64/development/$DIR/ \
   /srv/remote/x86_64/development/$DIR/
  done

 Enjoy NuTyX :)
