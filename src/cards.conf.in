## Please check man cards.conf(5)
#
## Folders where the recipes should be located.
## The order is important
## First found first compiled and/or first installed
##
## Note that it's the "base" packages which will be the last and the "gui-extra" packages
## the first and that we do specify the parent folder of the set of packages category:

## The NuTyX name and version are found in the /var/lib/pkg/nutyx-version file
## The Colletion name (gui, gui-extra, cli, cli-extra, base)
## must exist on the mirror https://downloads.nutyx.org (in this case)
## Check for your version what are the available collections at http://downloads.nutyx.org/x86_64/<version>
#
## We can specify which locale should be installed (more than one are allowed)
## Following example sets: german, dutch, and french locales
## The command 'setup-nutyx -cl' add the selected locale into cards.conf file
##
# locale de
# locale nl
# locale fr


## If you plan to build packages you will like this option otherwise just ignore it
##
## Cards can log the output of the creation of the final package when a:
#
#   cards create <name of package>
#
## if following variable is set and is refering to a folder: the compilation will be logged
# logdir /var/log/pkgbuild
